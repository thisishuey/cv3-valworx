<b>Valworx Limited Warranty</b><br />
<br />
Products manufactured by Valworx carry a minimum one-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. If a product proves defective in materials or workmanship within one year from the date of purchase, we will repair or replace it. The repair or replacement is your exclusive remedy and our sole obligation for any breach of warranty. With respect to those products sold by us but manufactured by a third party, we make no express warranties whatsoever and disclaim any thereof, and all such products are sold “AS IS, WHERE IS.” We will, however, try to pass along the benefit of any warranties provided by the third-party manufacturer.<br />
<br />
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS WARRANTY SECTION, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND WE HEREBY DISCLAIM SAME.<br />
<br />
In no event will we be liable, whether in contract, or under any other legal theory, for lost profits, revenue loss or similar economic loss in connection with any of our products or for any third party claims against you relating to the products. In no event will our monetary liability exceed the purchase price that you paid to us for the product.<br />
<br />
Warranties do not apply to products that have been subject to abnormal use, abnormal conditions, improper storage, exposure to moisture or dampness, unauthorized modifications, unauthorized repair, misuse, neglect, accident, alteration, improper installation or other acts which are not our fault, including damage caused in shipping. Our warranty also does not apply to any product that has been damaged by external causes such as fire, flood, sand, dirt, lightning, exposure to weather, or acts of God. To minimize the risk of potential safety problems, you should follow all applicable local and national codes that regulate the installation and operation of your equipment. Equipment damage or serious injury to personnel can result from the failure to follow all applicable codes and standards. We do not assume any responsibility for your product design, installation or operation. Our products are not fault tolerant and are not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft and support, navigation or communication systems, life support equipment, or other applications where our products could lead directly to death, personal injury or severe physical or environmental damage.<br />
